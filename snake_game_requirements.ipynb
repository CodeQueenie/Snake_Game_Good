    "Thank you for the clarifications. Here are the updated requirements for the Snake game:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements for Snake Game\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Game Interface**:\n",
    "   - Use Pygame for the graphical user interface.\n",
    "   - The game window should display the snake, food, score, and level.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Game Mechanics**:\n",
    "   - The snake should be able to move in four directions (up, down, left, right).\n",
    "   - The snake grows longer when it eats food.\n",
    "   - The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game window.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Levels**:\n",
    "   - Implement 5 levels with increasing difficulty.\n",
    "   - Each level should have a different speed for the snake.\n",
    "   - Optionally, add obstacles in higher levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Score Tracking**:\n",
    "   - Display the current score on the game window.\n",
    "   - Increase the score when the snake eats food.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Leaderboard**:\n",
    "   - Store the leaderboard in a local SQLite database.\n",
    "   - Save the player's name and score.\n",
    "   - Display the top scores on the leaderboard screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **User Interface**:\n",
    "   - Main menu with options to start the game, view the leaderboard, and exit.\n",
    "   - Game over screen with the option to restart or return to the main menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Sound Effects and Music**:\n",
    "   - Include sound effects for game actions (e.g., eating food, game over).\n",
    "   - Include background music with the ability to turn it on/off.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Implement graceful error handling with informative error messages.\n",
    "   - Log errors to a timestamped file, specifying which functions throw the specific error messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **User Management**:\n",
    "   - Ability to add new users.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Logging**:\n",
    "    - Add logging to a timestamped file for game events and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clarifying Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do you have any specific preferences for the format of the error messages and logs?\n",
    "2. Should the user management system include any specific features (e.g., user authentication, user profiles)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Please provide answers to these questions so I can proceed accurately."
