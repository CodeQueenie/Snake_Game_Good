COPILOT / Phind PROMPT DOCUMENTATION Project PROMPT:

## Documentating Each Module and Fucntion in the Snake Game:
Ingest each of the attached code lines. Iterate through each file and provide complete docstrings for each module,
and provide docstrings for each function and class in each module that explain what each one does. Give me back
each file fully documented so that I can save it and test it.

DO NOT CHNAGE ANY OF THE ACTIVE CODE. YOUR TASK IS TO PROVIDE GOOD HIGH-QUALITY
DOCUMENTATION FOR THE CODE THAT IS THERE. YOU SHOULD NOT CHANGE OR TRY TO IMPROVE THE
ACTIVE CODE IN ANY WAY.

# Overall (README md) Documnentation for the Snake Game Project:
Next we will create README.md file that will complete documentation for all parts of the game. Use the previous files
that were just documented to create the README.md file. This will be the final step in the documentation project.
